I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University, working under Dr.Gulmezoglu in the <a href="https://www.ece.iastate.edu/bgulmez" style="text-decoration: none;"><b>MAIS Lab</b></a>. My research focuses on determinating and mitigating security threats in modern computing systems (e.g., Intel, AMD, AR/VR devices), with a particular emphasis on (1) microarchitectural side-channel attacks and AI-driven mitigations and (2) machine learning security. By applying AI techniques, I strive to develop scalable solutions that protect user privacy and ensure trustworthy hardware and AI frameworks. Prior to joining Iowa State, I worked as an Assistant Manager in the ICT Infrastructure Strategy and Planning Team at South Korea’s South Korea’s National Information Society Agency (<a href="https://eng.nia.or.kr/site/nia_eng/main.do" style="text-decoration: none;"><b>NIA</b></a>).
