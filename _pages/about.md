I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University, working under Dr.Gulmezoglu in the <a href="https://www.ece.iastate.edu/bgulmez" style="text-decoration: none;"><b>MAIS Lab</b></a>. 

My research focuses on identifying and mitigating security threats in modern computing systems (e.g., Intel, AMD, and AR/VR devices) with emphasis on (1) **microarchitectural side-channel attacks** and **AI-driven mitigations** and (2) **machine learning security**.

By utilizing cutting-edge AI techniques with scalable security solutions, I strive to protect user privacy and build trustworthy hardware and software systems.
